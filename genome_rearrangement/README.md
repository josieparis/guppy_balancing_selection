## Directory containing scripts for the rearrangement of the genome

Chromosome 12 (LG12) rearrangements:
- movement and inversion of contigs (detailed in the functions)
- Based on Whiting _et al._ 2022: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41437-022-00512-6
- Based on Charlesworth _et al._ 2020: https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.120.401573

Chromosome 20 (LG20) rearragements:
- Add scaffold_94 to the beginning of the chromosome
- Based on Whiting _et al._ 2021: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009566

**NB ** a new genome with all new rearrangements incorporated into the fasta file is coming soon ...
